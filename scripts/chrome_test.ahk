#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0
;
; chrome_test.ahk — automated end-to-end test for the Chrome path.
;
; What it does, all unattended:
;   1. Locates Chrome's main YouTube window (or asks the user to open one).
;   2. Activates it, finds a real thumbnail anchor, moves the system cursor over it
;      so the page registers a hover (extension needs a real hovered video).
;   3. Clears the clipboard, presses Alt+A (the Windows user-facing hotkey handled by
;      copy.ahk), and waits for the clipboard sequence number to change.
;   4. Reports PASS / FAIL with the URL or timeout reason.
;
; Run it manually after you have YouTube open in Chrome with thumbnails visible.
; (Brave is left untouched — this script never activates Brave.)
;
; Output: prints to a MsgBox AND appends to scripts\chrome_test_log.txt.

; SendLevel 1 so copy.ahk's $!a:: hook (which by default has #InputLevel 0)
; will accept our synthetic Alt+A. Without this, AHK silently filters our
; keys from other AHK scripts' hooks.
